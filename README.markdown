# Simple Static Page Ensemble

### A simple ensemble for newbies that demonstrates how to create so called 'static pages'

A lot of people who make the switch to Symphony from other CMS systems have trouble understanding how you might create a site with static pages. I was exactly the same and so I thought it would be useful to have an ensemble that demonstrates one way of doing this.

This ensemble makes use of code from lots of great people. The idea for the settings file comes from [Nick Dunn][1] after I read a forum post of his. A settings file works really well with excellent [Static Section Extension][2] but it's not required for this ensemble to work. What is required for this ensemble to work is the [Root Page Params Extension][3] which does exactly what it suggests and lets the root page load params so you can have a really clean navigation system. This means that you just need one page template and can have a really simple structure. 

In terms of layout and style I used the [HTML5 Master Stylesheet][4] XSLT utility and some delicious typography from the clever folks who made [Type-A-Fil][5]e which is a great wee typography starter for getting something that looks good quickly. There's loads of really nice styles in the stylesheet to try out later. 

Obviously up for any suggestions that would make this better as I'm still a bit of a noob at a lot of this stuff!
