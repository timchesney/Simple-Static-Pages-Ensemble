#Root Page Params

Version 1.2

Written by Huib Keemink

## Intoduction

Adds the ability to add parameters to the root page (for instance: www.domain.com/params instead of www.domain.com/home/params)
With the new version (1.2) You can also add parameters to the parent page of the current page. (domain.com/parent/params instead of domain.com/parent/child/params)

##Installation

Place the folder in your extensions directory, then **rename the folder to root_page_params** (any way to make github do this?). Then enable as usual.

##Configuration

This version of the extension supports any page, not just the home page as in previous releases.

To set this page, go to the system->preferences page, and select the page from there.
